# Optimization Project

This is my small project for the course **Introduction to Computer Science and Optimization**, where I utilized coding knowledge from my first course to create/recreate algorithms for optimization problems in graph theory from the Optimization course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Implement fundamental graph optimization algorithms
- Apply theoretical concepts from the Optimization course to practical coding solutions
- Strengthen understanding of algorithmic complexity and efficiency
